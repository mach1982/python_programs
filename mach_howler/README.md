 Doing  a Big Data courses and I am looking for work placement, and was advised to follow up to companies. As I am dyslexic I have  habit of  over checking e-mail and tweets taking twice as long to send.
 Decided to let the computer to the work. 
 
 As we are learning Python, I decided to write a script to show what I can do to potential employers and to practice .
 I had  already experasnce  with python  and  twitter due to my involvement with the Coder Dojo  , so decided next the logical step was add to e-mail .
