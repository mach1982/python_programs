#####Using sentiment analysis to determine who will voted off from BBC Strictly Come Dancing 2018 .


The file strictly.py checks the sentiment form tweets for the a list of celebrities names in the  text file celbs.txt file. 

Each week the celebrity voted out will be remove from the celbs.txt.

#####Celbs taking part:
Ashley Roberts,Charles Venn,Danny John-Jules,Faye Tozer,Graeme Swann,Joe Sugg,Kate Silverton,Katie Piper,Lauren Steadman ,Lee Ryan,Dr. Ranj Singh,Seann Walsh,Stacey Dooley,Susannah Constantine,Vick Hope

After the 2nd week when the frist weeks vote took I have realised that the code needs a bit more tweaking  so  I will use the next few weeks to rewiret and calabrate it. There bound to be some theeting problems , as this is  my frist foray in to sentiment analysis.
